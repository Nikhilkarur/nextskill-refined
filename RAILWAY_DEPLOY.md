# ðŸš‚ Railway Deployment Guide - NextSkill

## Quick Deploy Steps

### 1. Go to Railway
- Visit: [railway.app](https://railway.app)
- Click **"Login"** â†’ **"Sign in with GitHub"**

### 2. Create New Project  
- Click **"Start a New Project"**
- Choose **"Deploy from GitHub repo"** 
- Select your **"nextskill-refined"** repository

### 3. Railway Auto-Configuration
- Railway will detect `railway.json` automatically
- All environment variables already configured:
  âœ… Neon PostgreSQL connection
  âœ… CORS settings for Netlify
  âœ… JWT secret
  âœ… Production profile

### 4. Build Process
- Build time: ~2-3 minutes
- Railway runs: `./mvnw clean package -DskipTests`
- Starts with: `java -jar target/backend-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

### 5. Get Your URL
- After deployment, you'll get a URL like:
  `https://nextskill-backend-production-xxxx.up.railway.app`
- Copy this URL for the next step

### 6. Update Netlify Proxy (After Railway Deploy)
Update `netlify.toml` with your actual Railway URL:
```toml
from = "/api/*"
to = "https://your-actual-railway-url.up.railway.app/api/:splat"
```

## Free Tier Limits
- âœ… **500 hours/month** (16+ hours/day)
- âœ… **No sleeping** - stays awake 24/7
- âœ… **1GB RAM, 1 vCPU**
- âœ… **Auto SSL certificates**

## What Gets Deployed
```
Your Railway App:
â”œâ”€â”€ Spring Boot backend
â”œâ”€â”€ Connected to Neon PostgreSQL
â”œâ”€â”€ JWT authentication
â”œâ”€â”€ Resume processing API
â”œâ”€â”€ Learning path generation
â””â”€â”€ CORS configured for Netlify
```

## Testing After Deploy
1. Visit your Railway URL directly â†’ Should see "Whitelabel Error Page"
2. Visit your Netlify site â†’ Should work normally
3. Test authentication flow
4. Try resume upload and learning path generation

## Troubleshooting
- **Build fails:** Check Railway logs for Maven errors
- **App crashes:** Check environment variables are set
- **CORS errors:** Verify Netlify proxy URL is correct
- **Database errors:** Verify Neon connection string
