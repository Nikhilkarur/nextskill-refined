6. **Progress Tracking** → Real-time progress sync across pages

### Data Flow:
```
Questionnaire → localStorage → Roadmap → Learning Dashboard
     ↓              ↓              ↓              ↓
User answers → Career path → Learning phases → Week completion

## 🔧 TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION

### Frontend Technologies:
- **HTML5** with semantic structure
- **Tailwind CSS** for responsive styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript** for interactivity
- **localStorage** for client-side data persistence
- **Space Grotesk** font for modern typography

### Key JavaScript Functions:
- `loadUserData()` - Loads questionnaire responses
- `updateRoadmapDisplay()` - Updates personalized roadmap
- `generateSimpleLearningPath()` - Creates career-specific learning phases
- `toggleWeekCompletion()` - Manages week completion status
- `saveProgress()` - Persists progress data
- `refreshProgress()` - Real-time progress sync

### Data Structure:
```javascript
// User Progress Object
{
  currentWeek: 1,
  totalWeeks: 16,
  completedWeeks: [1, 2, 3],
  completedAssignments: [0, 1],
  completionPercent: 18,
  careerPath: "Software Engineer"
}

// Career Path Object
{
  career_path: "Software Engineer",
  experience_level: "beginner",
  commitment_level: "full-time",
  skills: ["JavaScript", "React", "Node.js"],
  estimated_weeks: 16
}
```

## 🚀 DEPLOYMENT & SETUP

### Requirements:
- **Java 17+** for Spring Boot backend
- **Node.js** for frontend development server
- **PostgreSQL** for database
- **Modern browser** with localStorage support

### Quick Start:
```bash
# Clone and navigate to project
cd nextskill-project

# Start all services
start-all.bat

# Or start individually:
start-backend.bat    # Backend on :8080
start-frontend.bat   # Frontend on :5173
```

### URLs:
- **Frontend:** http://localhost:5173
- **Backend API:** http://localhost:8080
- **Database:** PostgreSQL on default port

## 📊 TESTING STATUS

### Manual Testing Completed:
- ✅ Complete user flow (questionnaire → roadmap → learning)
- ✅ Progress tracking and persistence
- ✅ Tab navigation in learning dashboard
- ✅ Week completion/incompletion
- ✅ Cross-page progress synchronization
- ✅ Responsive design on different screen sizes

### Automated Testing:
- **Playwright** test suite configured
- Tests located in `/tests/` directory
- Run with: `npm test`

## 🔄 PROGRESS TRACKING SYSTEM

### How It Works:
1. **Week Completion:** User clicks "Mark Complete" on any week
2. **Progress Calculation:** `(completed weeks / total weeks) * 100`
3. **Data Persistence:** Saved to localStorage with completion percentage
4. **Real-Time Sync:** Roadmap page checks for updates every 5 seconds
5. **Visual Feedback:** Progress bars and notifications update automatically

### Progress States:
- **Not Started:** Gray circle with week number
- **Completed:** Green circle with checkmark
- **Current:** Highlighted border and "Continue" button

## 🎨 DESIGN SYSTEM

### Color Palette:
- **Primary:** #00FF88 (NextSkill Green)
- **Secondary:** #10B981 (Accent Green)
- **Purple:** #8B5CF6 (Galaxy Purple)
- **Blue:** #3B82F6 (Galaxy Blue)
- **Cyan:** #06B6D4 (Galaxy Cyan)
- **Background:** Linear gradient (#1a1a1a → #2d2d2d)

### Typography:
- **Font:** Space Grotesk (Modern, Clean, Professional)
- **Hierarchy:** Clear heading levels with proper contrast

### Components:
- **Glass Cards:** `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` with backdrop blur
- **Buttons:** Gradient backgrounds with hover effects
- **Progress Bars:** Animated width transitions
- **Notifications:** Slide-in animations for feedback

## 📱 RESPONSIVE DESIGN

### Breakpoints:
- **Mobile:** < 768px (single column layouts)
- **Tablet:** 768px - 1024px (2-column grids)
- **Desktop:** > 1024px (3-column grids)

### Mobile Optimizations:
- Touch-friendly button sizes
- Simplified navigation
- Compressed content for small screens
- Swipe-friendly tab interface

## 🔒 DATA MANAGEMENT

### Client-Side Storage:
```javascript
// Key localStorage Items:
- 'currentUser': User authentication data
- 'questionnaireData': Raw questionnaire responses
- 'questionnaire_responses': Processed career path data
- 'userProgress': Progress tracking data
- 'currentLearningPath': Active learning path data
```

### Data Flow Security:
- Client-side validation for all inputs
- Sanitized data before localStorage storage
- Error handling for corrupted data
- Fallback defaults for missing data

## 🚧 KNOWN LIMITATIONS

### Current Scope:
- **Frontend-Only Progress:** Progress tracking is client-side only
- **Static Learning Content:** Learning materials are template-based
- **No User Accounts:** Authentication is localStorage-based
- **Limited Analytics:** No usage tracking or analytics

### Future Enhancements Recommended:
- Backend progress synchronization
- Real learning content integration
- User account system with database persistence
- Analytics and progress reporting
- Mobile app development
- Advanced learning algorithms

## 🎯 HANDOVER INSTRUCTIONS

### For Next Developer:

#### 1. **Immediate Tasks:**
- Test the complete flow: questionnaire → roadmap → learning
- Verify progress tracking works correctly
- Check responsive design on all devices

#### 2. **Code Quality:**
- All debugging code has been removed
- Production-ready clean codebase
- Consistent naming conventions
- Well-commented JavaScript functions

#### 3. **Key Files to Understand:**
- `questions.html` - Career assessment logic
- `roadmap.html` - Personalized roadmap generation
- `learning.html` - NPTEL-style learning dashboard
- `assets/js/` - Shared utility functions

#### 4. **Development Workflow:**
```bash
# Start development
start-all.bat

# Frontend: http://localhost:5173
# Backend: http://localhost:8080

# Make changes to frontend files
# Refresh browser to see changes

# For backend changes:
# Restart backend server after Java changes
```

#### 5. **Common Issues & Solutions:**
- **Progress not syncing:** Check localStorage data in browser DevTools
- **Button not working:** Verify JavaScript console for errors
- **Styling issues:** Check Tailwind CSS classes and browser compatibility
- **Backend connection:** Ensure both servers are running on correct ports
